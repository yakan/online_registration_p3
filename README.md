In this project, we'll build a responsive, mobile-friendly registration form using a wide variety of HTML form input types and attributes. Using the supplied mockup files, you'll build a mobile and desktop version of the form using media queries, and a mobile-first approach.

This online registration form includes all of the required form fields:
 - text input
 - email input
 - telephone input
 - select menu
 - checkboxes
 - radio buttons
 - textfield
 - submit button

Appropriate media query is in place to match the screen size for table and desktop screens at 768px.

This web page has been checked using HTML and CSS validator.
